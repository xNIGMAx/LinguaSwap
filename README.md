## 🧠 Why We Built It
As someone who loves languages and speaks four of them, I know firsthand how overwhelming learning a new one can be. From grammar drills to countless flashcards, it’s easy to feel discouraged. But what if learning could feel natural — like how we picked up our first language?

We built LinguaSwap to turn everyday browsing into an immersive context-based language-learning experience. We subtly replace random words on websites with their translations. The outcome? You learn by simply doing what you already do, such as reading articles, tweets, or shopping online.

Why does it work? Our brain thinks much faster than it reads, which is why we tend to predict the next words based on the context, even if are unfamiliar with the translated word. That "aha!" moment when you understand a term for the first time? It sticks, that's true learning 🧠
